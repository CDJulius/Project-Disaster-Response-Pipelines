# Disaster Response Pipeline Project

## What's This About?
This project is part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. It’s all about building a system to help emergency workers quickly sort and respond to disaster-related messages. Think of it like a smart assistant that reads messages (like tweets or texts) and figures out what kind of help is needed—food, water, medical aid, etc.

The project has three main parts:
1. **ETL Pipeline**: Cleans up messy data and organizes it into a database.
2. **ML Pipeline**: Trains a machine learning model to categorize messages.
3. **Web App**: A simple interface where you can type in a message and see how it gets categorized.
